# Data analysis project

Our project is titled "Sharpe Ratios and Volatility" and seeks to analyse how the sharpe ratio and the portefolio weights changes in a portefolio consisting of 20 random companies over 10 years (of course the same 20 through the 10 years). 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We apply the our data is imported directly from Yahoo Finance and we therefore do not have a .CSV-file.

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install matplotlib-venn``
