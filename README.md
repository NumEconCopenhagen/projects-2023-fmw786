This repository contains  
1. Inaugural project. 

2. Data project. We fetch data from **yahoo finance** on **20 companies in S&P500** and our project seeks to put together an optimal portofolio for the 20 companies over the last 10 years in a CAPM framework. Our analysis include computing covariances, expected returns, volatility, efficient frontier, sharpe ratio, etc.
The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

3. Model project. We model and analyze the **Solow model with human capital accumulation**. The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).
