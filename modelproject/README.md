# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **Analyzing the Solow model with human capital accumulation** and focuses on extending the basic Solow model to incorporate human capital. The main objective is to investigate the impact of savings rates on steady state values, considering both human and physical capital.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb) and [modelproject.py](modelproject.py).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
