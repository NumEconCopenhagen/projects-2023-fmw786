# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **Analyzing the Solow model with human capital accumulation.** and is about the extention to the basic Solow model, where human capital is included.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb). or  [modelproject1.ipynb](modelproject1.ipynb) if the first one is empty, as we had problems uploading.

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
