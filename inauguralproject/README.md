# Inaugural project
This project explores the relationship between gender, wages, and household work division using a parameterized utility model. By analyzing model parameters and their effects, we gain insights into how wage differences impact individuals' decisions regarding work and domestic responsibilities. The project aims to understand the dynamics of gender roles in economic contexts and contributes to the broader understanding of gender equality and labor market outcomes.
