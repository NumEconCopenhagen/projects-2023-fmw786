# Inaugural project

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [[inauguralproject.ipynb](https://github.com/NumEconCopenhagen/projects-2023-fmw786/blob/main/inauguralproject/Inaguralproject.ipynb)](inauguralproject.ipynb).

As we had some proplems with the initial python file, we copied all the content from the original inauguralproject.py file into a new file named pw.py. It should not cause any problem when running the inauguralproject.ipynb file. 
The import statement in inauguralproject.ipynb is therefore changed to import from pw.py

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
